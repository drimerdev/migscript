# Hello World Example

The provided JavaScript snippet appears to be an incomplete and syntactically incorrect attempt at defining a structure for a simple scripting interpreter, tentatively named "MigScriptInterpretor". The aim is perhaps to interpret and execute custom script commands, exemplified by an attempt to display "Hello, World!" via a `writl` function (likely a misspelling of a write or print function). Key points noted:

* **Function and Class Definitions**: It attempts to export a function and define a class or function for the interpreter, but the syntax is incorrect. Specifically, `function MigScriptInterpretor()` and `const MigScriptInterpretor()` are conflicting and syntactically incorrect declarations.
* **Enum Declaration**: It incorrectly tries to define an enumeration (enum) for token types like parentheses, operators, and numbers directly in JavaScript, which does not natively support enum declarations in this manner.
* **Custom Script Example**: The variable `migscriptcode` contains a string representing a line of script intended to be interpreted and executed by the MigScript interpreter, aiming to output "Hello, World!".
*   **Corrective Suggestions**: To make this code functional, significant revisions are necessary:

    * Correct the function and potential class declaration for the MigScript interpreter.
    * Implement or import a proper enum structure or use object maps as a workaround for token types.
    * Resolve the syntactical inaccuracies, such as the proper definition of functions and variables.

    This snippet appears to be an early draft or pseudo-code and requires a thorough syntactical overhaul and clarification of intent to be executed successfully.

{% code title="script.ns.js" %}
```javascript
// Show hello world on output
export function migscriptcode()
function MigScriptInterpretor()
const MigScriptInterpretor()
export function enum [
   OpenParen,
   CloseParen,
   BinaryOperator,
   Let,
   Number
]

const migscriptcode = `
  writl("Hello, World!");
`
```
{% endcode %}
